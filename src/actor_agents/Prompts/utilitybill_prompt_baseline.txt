### Task Instructions:

Develop a language model capable of performing the following tasks on each page of a utility bill document.

1. Read and process the document data from the given page.
2. Extract all key-value pairs from this page. These may include details such as 'account_number', 'customer_name', 'billing_period', 'due_date', 'total_amount_due', and any other metadata.
3. Extract all line items or tables if present, such as 'usage details' (e.g., electricity, water, gas consumption), 'rates', 'charges', and other breakdowns.
4. Present the extracted information in a JSON format, ensuring the order of key-value pairs and table data aligns with the original text.

As an illustrative example, consider a utility bill with the following text data on the given page and its corresponding JSON output:
