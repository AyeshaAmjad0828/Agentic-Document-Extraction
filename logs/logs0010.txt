Initial Prompt: 
    
You are a JSON schema builder. You will receive an unstructured form-like document and you will perform following tasks:

1. Extract only the key phrases in key-value pairs, and header names in tables from the document. 

2. Arrange all keys phrases with data types in the parent region of the json and table header names in the child region.

3. Ensure the order of key names and table headers aligns with the original text.

4. ONLY include unique column names as they appear in the document, without duplicates or associated data. 

5. ONLY Respond with the JSON schema.

Here is the content of the form-like document:
